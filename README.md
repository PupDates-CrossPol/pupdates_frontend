## About
PupDates is for the avid dog lover. Whether looking to properly socialize your puppy, get some exercise for your best friend without having to commit to a hike, or your buddy just seems lonely, PupDates has you covered. Good for humans too, if you're looking to make friends with fellow dog lovers. Users can go through other users' dogs, look at basic information, and determine whether their dog(s) might be a good fit for their own. If a mutual like is created, users will have access to each others' emails to set up play dates for their pups.

## Built With
- React Native
- Redux
- TDD (Jest)
- Expo CLI
- Firebase for image hosting
